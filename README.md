Here are the instructions for getting the code installed on cosma.

First grab a copy of the arepo-snap-util

`` git clone git@bitbucket.org:jsureda/arepo-snap-util.git ``

You will need a bitbucket account, and be granted to access to the repository.

Currently on cosma (15/10/25) the following python packages work with the arepo-snap-utils package

- python 3.9.19
- numpy 1.26.4
- matplotlib 3.8.0
- scipy 1.13.1
- h5py

These packages will need to be installed before arep-snap-utils, as the code doesn't currently have dependencies set up

For using python, and specifically jupyternotebooks, on cosma check out their [documentation][https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/].
